  <section class="biography">
    <h2>Biography - How did she get here?</h2>
    <p class="center">I was born and raised in Jacksonville, Florida, USA. In high school, I was a part of a small team of students who assisted teachers with
       school IT equipment. I went to college at Florida State University, but I wasn't ready to commit to my career goals yet. Symptomatic of this, I changed my 
       undergrad major several times. Ultimately, I obtained my first degree: a B.S. in Biology. After college, I worked as a hardware repair technician to fix 
       personal phones, tablets, and computers. When I moved out West, I was fortunate to find work with a national IT service business (CompuCom) as a field 
       service technician. Unfortunately, I developed some driving anxiety which forced me out of the position. Currently, I am attending Western Governors 
       University for Software Development. I am eager to collaborate with others to make fun and useful apps!</p>
